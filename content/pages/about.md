Hi, My name is CJ Stein.  I am a self-taught developer specializing in Django.  My goal with this blog is to document where I get stuck with problems and steps I take to solve them.  Or I will post about things I always forget how to do.  All of that in hopes that someone will luckily stumble upon this and find answers in their troubles as well.  The reaosn I am doing this is  because I am self-taught and I am hoping to help someone who is following in my footsteps, and I want them to catch up to me so that one day, we can work together and be at the same level, and also because others before me have done the same thign, and I want to continue their tradition they don't know they started.
