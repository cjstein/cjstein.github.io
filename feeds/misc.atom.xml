&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am CJ Stein.  This is my first post.  I have three main goals with this blog. 
1. To improve my writing by writing technical pieces.
2. To document areas where I stumble.  I am doing this to document for myself how I was able to get past things the first time and to maybe help others get past those same problems if they have them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want my posts not to be too long, nor do I want them to solve a very small problem or error, I want them to be more high level in showing steps I took to solve a problem.  I may document instances where I find myself forgetting how I do things as well which may seem specific.  I am excited for anyone else who joins the ride.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
